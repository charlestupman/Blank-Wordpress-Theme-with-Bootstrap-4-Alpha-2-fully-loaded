<h1>Blank Wordpress Theme With Bootstrap 4 Included for bespoke web development
<h2>Info</h2>
This is a completely blank theme for developers who with Bootstrap 4 Alpha fully loaded so that they can kick straight into bespoke theme developoment with only the framework for guidance. 
All Bootstrap framework settings are unchanged.
You will need a css complier that composes scss files. You only need to compose one file which is scss/blankcss.scss into scss/blankcss.css and everything will work.
Add new Scss files to /scss and then import them in the scss/blankcss.scss file (I have added the header to get you going)
jQuery is loaded in.
Have registered the main menu and sidebar.

<h2>Set Up</h2>
Just upload the blankTheme file to your themes directory, rename the file and get cracking.
Good luck!
